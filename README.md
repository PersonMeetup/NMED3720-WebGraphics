# Burnt Yet Doughy

*Burnt Yet Doughy* is a minigame built using the [P5 library](https://p5js.org/) that focuses on the act of cooking pancakes. In it, the user simply needs to keep track of pancakes as they cook on the pan. With no way to keep track of how long the pancakes need, the user must find their own way to measure time using what's avalible in the kitchen.
